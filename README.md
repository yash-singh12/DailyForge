## 🚀 Project Overview

Most productivity tools are either too bloated or too simple. **DailyForge** is a no-nonsense weekly planner that gives you total control over your schedule — built by students, for students and professionals alike.

**What it does:**
- Build a reusable **task library** with custom durations, colors, and categories
- Design **weekly routines** by dragging tasks into a visual time grid
- Save, update, and delete **routines** with one click
- Automatically detects and prevents **scheduling conflicts** for the same day

**Why it matters:**  
Most people don't fail to plan — they fail to stick to a plan. DailyForge makes routines feel visual and deliberate, making habits easier to build and track.

**Key highlights:**
- ⚡ Drag-and-drop weekly planner powered by `@dnd-kit`
- 🔒 Secure JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- 🗂️ Reusable routine templates to clone and reuse schedules
- 🚫 Conflict detection — no overlapping tasks on the same day
- 📱 Clean, responsive UI built with React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v18+, npm v9+, a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryandas2911/DailyForge.git
cd DailyForge
```

---

### 2. Set up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Create your `.env` file from the given template** (see the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below):

```bash
# Inside the /backend directory

cp .env.example .env   
```

Then fill in your values (see the next section for what each variable means).
> ⚠️ **Local dev note:** The backend CORS origin is currently configured for the deployed frontend in `backend/src/server.js`.  
> When running the frontend locally on `http://localhost:5173`, update the CORS origin temporarily for local development.
>
> Change this:
>
> ```js
> origin: "https://dailyforge-frontend-lhjq.onrender.com"
> ```
>
> to:
>
> ```js
> origin: "http://localhost:5173"
> ```
>
> before starting the backend server.


**Start the backend dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ✅ Server should start at `http://localhost:5000`

---

### 3. Set up the Frontend

Open a **new terminal**, then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

> ⚠️ > 💡 **Local dev note:** To point the frontend to your local backend, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` and ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

**Start the frontend dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ✅ App should open at `http://localhost:5173`

---

### ✅ You're ready!

Open `http://localhost:5173`, sign up for an account, and start building your routines.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables


### Backend — `backend/.env`

Copy the provided template to get started. **Never commit the .env to git.**

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
#CLIENT_ORIGIN=your_deployed_frontend_url
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | ✅ | Port on which the Express server runs (default: `5000`) |
| `MONGO_URI` | ✅ | Full MongoDB Atlas connection string — get it from your Atlas cluster's "Connect" menu |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Secret key for signing JWTs — use any long, random string (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | ⬜ | *(Optional)* Allowed CORS origin for API requests. Set this to your production frontend URL (e.g., `https://dailyforge-frontend-lhjq.onrender.com`). If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:5173` for local development. |

**How to get `MONGO_URI`:**
1. Log into [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Create a free M0 cluster (if you haven't)
3. Click **Connect** → **Connect your application** → Copy the connection string
4. Replace `<password>` with your DB user's password

### Frontend — `frontend/.env`

Copy the provided .env.example to a new file .env 


**Running locally?** Update `VITE_API_URL` in your local `.env` file to `http://localhost:5000/api/`.
